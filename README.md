# Tablet Cashbox React UI
Hi there! I created this project during one of the boring nights as a practice of my React, Redux etc skills. For me it's just a practice to improve my skills.

In this project you can find Browser Cashbox, which can help you organize your business with just one tablet. On the screen you can see two main areas: <br/>
* Cart on the right side of the screen
* List of items of your business with groups (folders) etc 

Also at the top of the screen you can see small navigation bar. Now it doesn't have any functionality, but I want to improve it in case this UI will be useful for many people (or it will be another boring night).

As you can see, it's not a serious project. That's why I can't sell it or something else, I don't know. And that's why I can afford informal description.

### Usage 
You can start the project using command in your command line:
```
yarn start
```
I used `yarn` package manager. If you want to start this project via `npm` just Google how you can do it.

### How does it look like?
