# Tablet Cashbox React Ui
Hi. I was create this projiect in the one of boring nights as a practice of my React, Redux etc skills. For me it's just a practice, by which i can improve my skills.

In this project you can find Browser Cashbox, which can help you to oranize you business with just one tablet. So, in the screen you can see two main areas: <br/>
* Cart on the right side of screen
* List of items of your business with groups (folders) etc 

Alse at the top of the screen you can see small navigation bar. Now it has not any functionality, but I wanna improve it in the case, where this UI will be useful for many people (or it will be one else boring night).

As you can see, it's not a serious project. That's why I can't sell it or somethink else, I don't know. And that's why I can afford informal description.

### Usage 
You can start the project using command in your command line:
```
yarn start
```
I used `yarn` packet manager. If you want to start this project via `npm` just Google how you can do it.

### How does it look like?
